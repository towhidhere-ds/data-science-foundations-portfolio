## Project: Biodiversity Analysis in National Parks

### Overview
This project explores biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, focusing on species diversity, conservation efforts, and ecological trends across four national parks:
- Yellowstone National Park
- Yosemite National Park
- Great Smoky Mountains National Park
- Bryce National Park

Through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, the project uncovers insights into species distributions and conservation priorities.

### Key Questions
- What is the distribution of conservation statuses for species?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Which parks have the highest and lowest biodiversity based on observations and unique species counts?
- Which species are most frequently or rarely observed in each park?
- Is there a significant relationship between species categories and conservation statuses?


### Data Sources
- **National Parks Service**:
  - `species_info.csv`: Contains species information such as category, scientific names, and conservation statuses.
  - `observations.csv`: Records the number of species observations in the four national parks.

### Visualizations
This project features several visualizations, including:
- Bar plots showing the distribution of conservation statuses.
- Heatmaps and bar plots highlighting the most and least observed species.
- Comparative plots of biodiversity richness across parks.

### Project Scoping
**Objective**: To analyze and visualize biodiversity data from four national parks to uncover trends in species diversity and conservation.

**Scope**:
1. Investigate conservation statuses and species diversity.
2. Identify parks with the highest biodiversity richness and those needing conservation focus.
3. Highlight endangered species trends and draw actionable insights for conservation efforts.

**Deliverables**:
- Cleaned datasets
- Visualizations of biodiversity trends
- Statistical analysis of conservation statuses
- Insights and recommendations for conservation planning
